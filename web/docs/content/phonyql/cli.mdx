## Initialize Database

Phony requires a local copy of your database to allow persisting the data
changes via mutations.
To make sure you always have a local copy you can add the `--init,-i` flag.
This will flush the database to a local copy if the file does not exist.
If the file exists, this step is simply skipped.

```bash
phonyql -i
```

## Flush Database

You might want to flush the database every time you restart the server.
Adding the `--flush,-f` flag makes sure your database is always reset to its
initial state.

```bash
phonyql -f
```

You can additionally pass the `--no-serve,-n` flag if you don't
want to start the server

```bash
phonyql -fn
```

## Custom input

While Phony looks for the `db.js` file in your `cwd`, you can specify a custom
file as second argument. It can be helpful
when you need to run several servers or have a certain folder/file structure.

```bash
phonyql my-database.js
## phonyql some/deep/folder/my-database.js
```

## Custom output

You can define the destination file of the local database with the `--database,-d` flag.
This will change the location and name of your local database. It can be helpful
when you need to run several servers or have a certain folder/file structure.
The default file will be written to `[cwd]/db.json`.

```bash
phonyql -d my-database.json
## phonyql -d some/deep/folder/my-database.json
```

## Custom port

You can define the port of the local network with the `--port,-p` flag.
It can be helpful when you need to run several servers or port `1337` is taken.
The default port is `1337`.

```bash
phonyql -p 3000
```

## Export schema

Using the `--export,-e` flag you can export the generated schema.
This can be useful if you want to build your production service from this setup.

```bash
phonyql -e
```

If you want to specify the schema filename and location you can specify it using
the `--schema,-s` flag

```bash
phonyql -es my-schema.graphql
## phonyql -es some/deep/folder/my-schema.graphql
```

## Running two instances

You can run two or more instances using tools like [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently)

```bash
concurrently "phonyql one.js -d one.json -p 3001" "phonyql two.js -d two.json -p 3002"
```
