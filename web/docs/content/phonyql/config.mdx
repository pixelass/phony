```ts
interface PonyConfig {
	queryConfig?: {
		get: {
			byId: string;
			all: string;
			meta: string;
		};
		post: {
			create: string;
			update: string;
			delete: string;
		};
		input: {
			filter: string;
			filterFields: string;
			create: string;
			update: string;
		};
		internalFields: {
			created: string;
			updated: string;

		};
	};
	schema?: string;
	input?: string;
	database?: string;
	port?: string | number;
}
```

## Query Config

the `queryConfig` allows you to define names for your query types and inputs.
The word `name` is used in different variations as a placeholder.

for "users":

* `hello [name]!` => hello user!
* `hello [Name]!` => hello User!
* `hello [names]!` => hello users!
* `hello [Names]!` => hello Users!

If you expect `getUserById` for the `get.byId` method you can write: `get[Name]ById`.

### Internal Fields

Phony writes two properties (updated, created) which can be defined via the
`internalFields` property of the `queryConfig` object.
To change the names, simply define them in your config.

```
{
	created: "createdAt",
	updated: "lastUpdate"
}
```

You can also add fields from your data that should not appear in the update
input. This can be helpful if you want to prevent certain fields from being
updated.

{
	views: "views",
	upvotes: "likes",
	downvotes: "dislikes",
	secret: "neverAllowChangingMe"
}
