## Why Phony?

Phony was inspired by [json-graphql-server](https://github.com/marmelab/json-graphql-server).
I needed to mock a graphql service with a persistent database and figured I
might want to use this again, so I created this project.

### When should I use this?

-   to create a simple mvp with graphql
-   to build custom static site builders
-   when using the same schema in production
    -   in test environments
    -   in dev environments
